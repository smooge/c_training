# Code Finger Exercises #

When learning the piano or other musical instruments, it is necessary
to do regular finger exercises to get various chords, movements, and
styles into ones brain. Then even after you have mastered the
instrument, you will find that regular returning to the exercises are
needed to keep your skills fresh, or to warm up to a larger engagement. 

After many years of doing different coding in short bits, I believe the
same is with coding. While I have 'learned' many different languages
over the years, I have also not focused on many of them for very
long. I had also come to realize I have bought many books over the
time, done some of the exercises here and there, but not fully focused
on them. So this project is meant to work through some of those books
examples and exercises to get some of the rust off the mental blade. 

# Note: License #

Since many of these are short works taken from books, the licensing of
the 'code' involved is difficult. I will endeavor to make sure that
segments copied from verbatum have the book, page and authors
listed.
