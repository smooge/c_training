# K&R C #

The exercises and examples are taken from a copy of the second edition
of the classic C programming book, Kernighan and Ritchie's _The C
Programming Language_. From its first edition in 1978 to the mid 1990's,
this was the go-to book to learn the C language. It is one of the
most densely packed programming language books with its 260 pages
covering as much material as multiple tomes in other series. 

The C language covered in the book is the ANSI C standard which had been
finalized around 1989. The C language was originally meant to help
program operating systems and system tools on systems where typing was
via teletype and cost dollars per minute of code time. As such the
language valued succinct typing over verbosity and many of the examples
will use 1 letter variables or other shortcuts. Also the language is
notorious for allowing the programmer to shoot themselves in the foot
repeatedly.

The standard has gone through several updates with it currently being
based on the '2018 C17' or the soon to be finalized '2024 C23'. What is
considered 'safe' programming has changed a lot since the 1970's. My
hope is to improve the original examples to use what are considered
'good' habits these days.
